# Web app - A Silent Bookclub 
## React web app created using Firebase.

Link to the app: https://thesilentbookclub.web.app

## Creating an account

In order to use the app, an account is necessary. Once a new account is created or an already existing one is entered, the user can have access to their own journal, see events created by other users or create one themselves, search through database of books and add them to their own collection.

## Events

Users can create events. Each event will have it's own page, where discussions will have place in the form of comments. Each comment can be responded to, resulting in a threaded comments system, similar to Reddit's.

Besides replying to any comment, a user can delete or edit the content of their own comments. They can also leave a like or dislike to other comments, but also cancel the like/dislike. 

## Book library.

Users can search for any title or author of their choosing and options will be provided by Google's book API. Once a user adds a book to their collection, they can choose a status for it and give it review. If they choose to make the review public, it will be seen on everyone's dashboard. Reiews can ebe replied to, the resulting replies resembling YouTube's comment system.
