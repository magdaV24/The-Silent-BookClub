# Web app - A Silent Bookclub 
## React web app created using Firebase.

After creating an account, users can search for any book of their interest, thanks to Google's book API. Each user can add books to their collection and rate it, either publicly or pivately. When a review is public, it can be seen by other users on their User Dashboard. They can reply, like or dislike the post. 

Users can also create events centered around any work of literature of their choice. On the event's page, users can leave comments on a nested loop. Comments can also be edited, deleted, liked or disliked. When someone interacts with someone's comments, the author will recieve a notification.
