# The-Silent-BookClub
A web application for everyone looking after a place to discuss books, but in silence. Build using React.js and Firebase.

Make an account, look around the events that are available or suggest one yourself.

Each user has their own journal. Their entries can only be seen by them.![journal1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114444914/204759392-a5ec09ff-9a69-4731-93f2-ac9a30eb39f3.png)

The events page is where all the events are listed and a brief description and a link to the event's page is provided. ![events](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114444914/204759865-356bc1fc-f9bb-4ea3-bbef-8f1bf2855135.png)

Once the user goes to an event's page, they have the option of becoming a participant and leave comments.![event-page1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114444914/204760500-194a8743-a48f-4eba-8903-88873e43e1a8.png)
