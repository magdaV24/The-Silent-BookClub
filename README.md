# The-Silent-BookClub
A web application for everyone looking after a place to discuss books, but in silence.

Make an account, look around the events that are available or suggest one yourself. When you find the one right for you, join in and participate in discussions. You can also write your thoughts down as you go through the chosen book and save them in your personal diary, that can only be read by you.
